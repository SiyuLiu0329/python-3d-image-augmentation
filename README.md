# Python 3D Image Augmentation for 3D Image Segmentation
This is a libaray/framework containing a collection of mothods for 3D image data augmentation. Its intended usage is pair-wise (simultanous) augmentation of medical image data and their corresponding manual segmentation masks. It also supports non-pair-wise augmentation.
